## The Algorithm: First start by setting up the camera. Next the task of your project must be defined. So the project was defined as clothing. Following this step, the categories within this task must be defined. (pants, shorts, t_shirt, longsleeve). The number of datasets must also be defined in this cell. Also setting up the data directory for where the data is stored. Following the step that sets up the data directory, the model cell must be set up which defines the neural network used. The next cell executes the live execution which initiates the live camera. Following this, the training and evaluation step is next which confirms the project can be tested and provide feedback. The interactive tool is next set up and it displays the widgets to train and test and see the data collection. The next cell combines all the widgets to one place together. Once done the last cell must shut down the project.

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here.
